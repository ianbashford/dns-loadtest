# dns-loadtest

This isn't going to be sophisticated, but I'm trying to solve two things.

First, my doh server ran into performance issues back in Feb and I'd like to understand why.
Second, I want to investigate whether the inet.af/netaddr library will make an appreciable difference to the memory used in https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-proxy
